## How the config works
Basically, this works for every Entry, Category or Commerce Product. By default, nothing is overwritten. In the settings of the plugin, you can adjust the overwriting per type (section, product type, category group). 

If the overwriting of the slugs on a type has been enabled, then this setting applies to elements which have been saved the last time before installing the plugin or are newly created.

In practice, this means that old elements are not touched at first. But if you want to edit such an old element, which should be overwritten by the section according to the default setting, then the existing slug will be overwritten by default. However, if the element should keep its slug, then switch off the light switch and save the element. Then the light switch is off when editing the element again.

### Supported Types
 * Entries
 * Categories
 * Commerce Products
